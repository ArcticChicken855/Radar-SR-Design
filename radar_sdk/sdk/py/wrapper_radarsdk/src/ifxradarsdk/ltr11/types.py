    mode: 
        Operating mode of the chip (Default is pulsed mode).

    rf_frequency_Hz:
        The RF center frequency in Hz.
    
    num_of_samples:
        The num_of_samples count representing the number of samples per frame per readout
        required. Allowed values are between 16 and 1024.
    
    detector_threshold:
        The detection threshold level. Allowed values are between 0 and 4095.

    prt:
        The pulse repetition time index, which corresponding value defines the time 
        until next pulsing sequence starts in pulsing.
        The get_prt_value method can be used to get the prt value in us from the prt index. 

    pulse_width:
        The pulse width corresponding to the time sampling is active during one pulsing event.  
    
    tx_power_level:
        The Medium power amplifier gain control.

    rx_if_gain:
        The Baseband PGA gain setting.
    
    aprt_factor:
        The Adaptive Pulse Repetition time factor. Initially the APRT is disabled.
        When enabled, the PRT is multiplied by this factor when no target is 
        detected.

    hold_time:
        The hold time for target detection. 

    disable_internal_detector:
        Flag indicating when true that the internal detector needs to be disabled.
