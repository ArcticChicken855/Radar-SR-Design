 * @brief Retrieves the next frame of time domain data from a radar device.
 *

 * connected device. The samples from all chirps and all enabled RX antennas
 * (virtual RX antennas in case of MIMO) will be copied to the provided *frame*
 * data structure of type \ref ifx_Cube_R_t (where rows = number of virtual antennas,
 * columns = chirps per frame, and slices = samples per chirp).
 * If the provided structure is NULL then a structure is created by the function.
 *
 * When time domain data is acquired by a radar sensor device, it is copied into an instance of
 * \ref ifx_Cube_R_t. Each row of the \ref ifx_Cube_R_t contains data corresponding to each
 * virtual active Rx antenna.
 * Columns correspond to chirps, slices correspond to samples.
 *
 * For a description of the frame structure see \ref sct_radarsdk_device_config_guide_measurement_frame and
 * For a description of virtual Rx antenna ordering in the *MIMO* use case see
 * \ref sct_radarsdk_device_config_guide_virtual_antenna_order.
 *
 * Here is a typical usage of this function:
 * @code
 *      ifx_Cube_R_t* frame = NULL;
 *      while(1)
 *      {
 *          frame = ifx_avian_get_next_frame(device_handle, frame);
 *          ifx_Error_t ret = ifx_error_get_and_clear();
 *          if(ret == IFX_ERROR_TIMEOUT)
 *              continue; // no data available, do something else
 *          else if(ret != IFX_OK)
 *              // error handling
 *              break;
 *
 *          // process data
 *          // ...
 *      }
 *      ifx_cube_destroy_r(frame);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The function blocks until a full frame has been received or an error
 * occurred. Possible errors are:
 *  - \ref IFX_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_ERROR - communication error between board and
 *    host. This error typically occurs if the board was unplugged while fetching
 *    data.
 *  - \ref IFX_ERROR_FIFO_OVERFLOW - the radar board could not fetch the data
 *    fast enough from the radar sensor. The FIFO of the radar sensor overflowed
 *    and the state machine of the radar sensor was stopped. This typically
 *    occurs with radar configurations that cause high data rates, e.g. high
 *    frame rate, many activated receiving antennas, many samples per frame...
 *  - \ref IFX_ERROR_TIMEOUT - no full frame was available within 10 seconds.
 *  - \ref IFX_ERROR - an unknown error occurred.
 * The error status can be retrieved by calling ifx_error_get() after this function call.
 *
 * This function is equivalent to a call to \ref
 * ifx_avian_get_next_frame_timeout with a timeout of 10 seconds. For high
 * values of the frame repetition time (10 seconds or larger, corresponding to
 * a frame rate of 0.1Hz or lower) the function might return \ref
 * IFX_ERROR_TIMEOUT. In that case, please use \ref
 * ifx_avian_get_next_frame_timeout instead.
 *
 * This function automatically starts the time domain data acquisition if not
 * previously specified. It is not required to call \ref
 * ifx_avian_start_acquisition manually.
 *
 * The radar sensor sends the time-domain data in slices and not in full frames.
 * This means that after fetching a frame it does not necessarily take
 * frame_repetition_time_s seconds until this function returns the next frame.
 * For example, if both the frame and the frame repetition time are small (not
 * too many samples in a frame, high frame rate), one slice may contain several
 * frames. In this case two calls to \ref ifx_avian_get_next_frame will return
 * a frame immediately.
 *
 * See also \ref ifx_avian_start_acquisition and \ref
 * ifx_avian_get_next_frame_timeout.
 *
 * @param [in]     handle    A handle to the radar device object.
 * @param [out]    frame     The frame (\ref ifx_Cube_R_t) structure where the time domain data should be copied to.
 *                           If set to NULL, then a new structure is created which the caller is responsible to free.
 *                           The frame is a cube of dimensions:
 *                           num_rx_antennas (rows) x num_chirps_per_frame (cols) x num_samples_per_chirp (slices)
 *
 * @return \ref ifx_Cube_R_t pointer to structure where the time domain data is populated.
 *                           This would be the same as the *frame* parameter if it is present.
 *                           If the *frame* parameter is NULL it would point to a newly allocated memory containing
 *                           a frame (\ref ifx_Cube_R_t) structure which the caller is
