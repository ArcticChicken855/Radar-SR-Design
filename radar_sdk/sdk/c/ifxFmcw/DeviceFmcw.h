 * @brief Retrieves the next frame of time domain data from a radar device

 * This function retrieves the next complete frame of time domain data from the

 * will be copied to the provided *frame* data structure. For details, how data
 * is stored an the frame structure, see @ref ifx_Fmcw_Raw_Frame_t.
 *
 * The function will either populate the current frame into the structure
 * as soon as a complete frame is available or return if an
 * @ref IFX_ERROR_TIMEOUT occurs if no frame was available within *timeout_ms*
 * of milliseconds. The possible errors are
 * @ref IFX_OK                           if the function succeeded.
 * @ref IFX_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_ERROR    if a communication error occurred.
